            <p class="lead">Version Control is a great way to ensure that your files are saved at every stage of the development process. A Version Control System, like Git for example, saves every version of your files. It is also a great way for collaboration work. If you need to share your files with other people, a VCS like Git, can allow others to access the files and edit them. The VCS will save all of their changes, along with name of the user that made them, and when they did so. It will also save this newly edited file into a new version, so if for some reason you needed to use the previous version, you could still do so.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Topic 2 Header</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a Version Control System that can be used to store files. It was created to make the process simpler for developers. Git basically takes a "snapshot" when you commit a file, and saves that version. Every time you commit a file, it is saved, unless it is exactly the same as it was before, then Git will link the file to the previous version. Git makes it extremely easy to access files and edit them. It looks at the data differently from other Version Control Systems, and it is much more user friendly. Git is a great way to view older versions of your file, while making changes to it.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To reiterate what I said earlier, Git is a great tool for developers that can help them save earlier versions of their work. In order to take advantage of the many benefits Git has to offer, one must familiarize themself with Git commands, and how to use and navigate the site. One must use commands to initiate the use of Git, to ensure that their files will appear in the Version Control System. One must also use the commands to make sure that each version of their file is saved. In order to do this, the user needs to "commit" the file to Git. This must be done every time the developer wants to save a version. Many Git commands must be used and understood to utilize Git to its full potential.</p>
